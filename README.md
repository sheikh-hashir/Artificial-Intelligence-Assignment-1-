# Artificial-Intelligence-Assignment-1-
It is coded in c++ 

The project contains 2 source files, one which takes input from a file "input.txt" and other takes input from standard input

The user had to first input the number of states, actions and test cases

Then the user will enter the states in which the agent can move in a string of N index

Then the user wil enter the possible actions performed by the agent in a string of M index

Then the program will take input in 2D integer array of NxM.

Then the user will enter a string which will have the starting and ending state tab separated

Finally the program will show whether the path exist or not and displays the actions performed by the agent to that path.

If the number of test cases are finished the program will terminate else it will ask the user to enter the string.

A sample file is attached in this project which follows exactly the same input criteria.
